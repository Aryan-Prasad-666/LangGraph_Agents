            "Data Summary: Over the next eight months (June to January), Punjab, India's loamy soil (pH 6.5, high N, medium P, adequate moisture, low K) supports a dual cropping cycle, transitioning from hot, wet monsoon conditions to cooler winter weather.\n\nFor the Kharif season (June-October), with very high temperatures (up to 109F) and monsoon rains (July-August), **Rice** is highly suitable, showing minimal climate change impact. However, **Maize** and **Cotton** face significant projected yield reductions (13% and 11%) from rising temperatures, necessitating heat-tolerant varieties or diversification.\n\nThe Rabi season (November-January) offers cooler temperatures. **Wheat** is well-suited, with an adapted sowing date around November 24th. Other viable options include **Mustard**, **Barley**, and **Chickpea**. **Potato** productivity is projected to decline by 5-6%. Potassium supplementation is crucial due to low soil levels, and efficient water management is paramount.",
            "DeepSeek Plan: <think>\nOkay, so the user is an agricultural planner for Punjab, India, and they've given me a detailed data summary. They want me to propose a crop plan over an 8-month period, from June to January. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the two main cropping seasons in Punjab: Kharif and Rabi. Kharif is from June to October, which is the monsoon season, and Rabi is from November to January, the cooler winter season.\n\nLooking at the soil data, it's loamy with a pH of 6.5. The nutrients are high in Nitrogen, medium Phosphorus, and low Potassium. Moisture is adequate, so that's a plus, but the low K is something to address.\n\nFor Kharif, the climate is hot and wet. Rice is highly suitable here because it's resistant to the monsoon conditions and high temperatures. But Maize and Cotton might not be the best choices because of the projected yield reductions due to rising temps. So, I should focus on Rice as the primary crop for Kharif.\n\nNow, for Rabi, the weather cools down, making it ideal for crops like Wheat, Mustard, Barley, and Chickpea. Wheat is especially well-suited, and the data suggests sowing around November 24th. Mustard and Barley are also good options, and Chickpea can be a legume to diversify. However, Potato productivity is expected to decline, so maybe it's better to avoid that unless necessary.\n\nThe soil's low Potassium is a concern. So, I should include K supplementation in the plan, maybe through fertilizers. Also, efficient water management is crucial, especially since the moisture is adequate but we don't want to waste it.\n\nI should structure the plan to transition smoothly from Kharif to Rabi. Starting with Rice in June, ensuring it's harvested by October. Then, preparing the soil for Wheat and other Rabi crops, making sure to apply the necessary nutrients and manage water efficiently.\n\nI also need to consider crop rotation to maintain soil health. Maybe alternating between Rice and Wheat with some legumes or mustard can help with nutrient cycling.\n\nIn summary, the plan should prioritize Rice for Kharif and Wheat, Mustard, and Chickpea for Rabi. Include specific planting dates, address the low K issue, and ensure water is used efficiently. This should align with the soil and climate conditions and help mitigate the effects of climate change on crop yields.\n</think>\n\nFor the next eight months, Punjab's agricultural plan should focus on optimizing crop selection and management to align with soil conditions, climate patterns, and the dual cropping cycle. **Rice** should be prioritized for the Kharif season (June-October), given its suitability under hot, wet monsoon conditions and minimal climate change impact. Planting should begin in June, leveraging the monsoon rains, and harvesting by October. For the Rabi season (November-January), **Wheat** is the most viable option, with an adapted sowing date around November 24th to capitalize on cooler temperatures. Additionally, **Mustard** and **Chickpea** can be integrated as secondary crops, offering diversification and resilience against temperature fluctuations. **Potato** should be avoided due to projected yield declines. Potassium supplementation is critical to address soil deficiencies, and efficient water management practices, such as drip irrigation, should be implemented to conserve moisture and enhance productivity. This plan ensures a balanced and sustainable cropping cycle, maximizing yields while adapting to climate challenges.",
            "Gemini Plan: For the 8-month period from June to January, Punjab's agricultural strategy will prioritize a dual cropping cycle, beginning with the Kharif season (June-October) where **Rice** will be the primary crop. Planting should commence in June to fully utilize the monsoon rains, with harvesting completed by October, leveraging its minimal climate change impact under hot, wet conditions; Maize and Cotton should be largely avoided due to significant projected yield reductions. Transitioning to the Rabi season (November-January), **Wheat** is the optimal choice, with an adapted sowing date around November 24th to capitalize on cooler temperatures, alongside **Mustard** and **Chickpea** for diversification and soil health benefits, while **Potato** will be excluded due to anticipated productivity declines. Crucially, **Potassium supplementation** must be integrated into fertilization schedules to address the soil's low K levels, and **efficient water management practices**, such as drip irrigation, are paramount to conserve the adequate moisture and ensure sustainable crop production across both seasons.",
            "GPT Plan: For the June-October Kharif window, sow a short-duration, heat-tolerant rice variety (e.g., MTU 1010) on 5-10June using a 20-day pre-monsoon nursery and transplant on 20-25June to capture peak July-August rains; apply a basal dose of N-P-K (120-60-30kgha) at transplant with an additional split of potassium (KO30kgha) at tillering (mid-July) and again at panicle initiation (early September) to offset the soils low K, and run drip-line irrigation at 5mmday during dry spells to conserve water while maintaining adequate soil moisture; harvest the rice by 18-20October, incorporate the straw into the field as green manure or mulch to boost organic matter. Immediately after harvest, plow the field and apply a starter dose of K (15kgKOha) and zinc (5kgZnSOha) to prepare for the Rabi season. For the November-January cycle, sow wheat on 24November (seed rate120kgha) with a N-P-K regimen of 120-60-30kgha split as 50% at sowing, 30% at tillering (early December) and the remaining 20% at booting, again topping up K (20kgKOha) at tillering; inter-crop mustard (seed rate3kgha) on 5December and chickpea (seed rate25kgha) on 12December using ridge-fallow or relay planting to maximize land use and fix nitrogen, both receiving the same K top-dress; employ drip or low-flow sprinkler irrigation (3mmday) during dry spells and schedule a final K-rich fertilizer before wheat heading (early January) to ensure grain filling. This integrated plan builds on earlier recommendations by timing potassium applications to critical growth stages, using drip irrigation throughout both seasons, and adding mustard-chickpea inter-crops for soil health and diversification while deliberately excluding maize, cotton, and potato, which face yield penalties under the projected climate scenario."
