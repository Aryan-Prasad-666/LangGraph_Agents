            "Data Summary: Assam's loamy soil, characterized by a favorable pH of 6.5, high nitrogen, medium phosphorus, and adequate moisture (though low potassium requiring supplementation), supports diverse agriculture.The hot, humid, and rainy season (March/April to October), with temperatures frequently exceeding 86°F and increasing extreme rainfall events, is highly suitable for **paddy rice, jute, sugarcane, and tropical fruits** like banana and pineapple. However, climate change, including rising temperatures and altered rainfall, threatens rice yields and necessitates climate-resilient varieties and sustainable practices.The cooler, drier winter months (November to February/March), with temperatures ranging from 53°F to 73°F, are ideal for **winter vegetables** (e.g., cabbage, potato, tomato), **pulses, and oilseeds** (e.g., mustard). Tea, a major crop, may experience shifts in suitable growing areas. Farmers must adapt to increasing heatstrokes and variable weather for sustained productivity.",
            "DeepSeek Plan: <think>Okay, so the user is an agricultural planner for Assam, and they need a 12-month crop plan. Let me break this down.First, I look at the soil data. It's loamy with a pH of 6.5, which is good. High nitrogen, medium phosphorus, but low potassium. So, I'll need to supplement potassium for crops that need it.Now, the climate. The hot, humid, rainy season from March to October is perfect for paddy rice, jute, sugarcane, and tropical fruits like bananas and pineapples. But climate change is a threat here—rising temps and unpredictable rainfall. So, I should suggest climate-resilient rice varieties and sustainable practices like mulching or intercropping to maintain soil health and prevent erosion.Then, the cooler, drier winter from November to February/March. This is great for winter vegetables like cabbage, potato, tomato, pulses, and oilseeds such as mustard. These crops will do well in the cooler temps and can be rotated to maintain soil fertility. Plus, they can be harvested before the next rainy season starts.Tea is a major crop in Assam, but with changing weather, the suitable areas might shift. So, I should consider planting tea in areas that are expected to remain suitable and maybe suggest monitoring for any changes.I also need to think about the farmers. They're facing increasing heat and variable weather, which can affect productivity. So, the plan should include practices that help them adapt, like using drought-resistant varieties, efficient irrigation, and maybe agroforestry to shade crops from extreme heat.Putting it all together, I'll structure the plan into two main seasons: Kharif and Rabi. For Kharif, focus on rice, jute, sugarcane, and fruits. For Rabi, shift to vegetables, pulses, oilseeds, and tea. Make sure to mention the need for potassium supplementation and integrating climate-resilient practices throughout.I should also note the importance of crop rotation and intercropping to maintain soil health and prevent pests. This way, the plan is sustainable and resilient against the challenges posed by climate change.So, the final plan should clearly outline each season's crops, planting times, and the necessary considerations to ensure productivity and adaptability. That should cover all the bases for a comprehensive 12-month agricultural plan in Assam.</think>For Assam, a 12-month crop plan should leverage the state's loamy soil, favorable pH of 6.5, and nutrient profile (high nitrogen, medium phosphorus, low potassium) while adapting to its climate. During the hot, humid, and rainy season (March/April to October), focus on paddy rice, jute, sugarcane, and tropical fruits like banana and pineapple, ensuring the use of climate-resilient rice varieties and sustainable practices such as intercropping and mulching to mitigate extreme rainfall and rising temperatures. In the cooler, drier winter months (November to February/March), prioritize winter vegetables (cabbage, potato, tomato), pulses, and oilseeds like mustard, which thrive in the temperate conditions. Tea cultivation should be strategically planned in areas less vulnerable to shifting climate zones, with ongoing monitoring for yield and soil health. Potassium supplementation will be critical for all crops, given the soil's low levels. Crop rotation and intercropping should be integrated to maintain soil fertility and reduce pest pressure. Farmers should also adopt agroforestry practices and drought-resistant crop varieties to build resilience against increasing heat and weather variability.",
            "Gemini Plan: For Assam, a comprehensive 12-month agricultural plan leverages the loamy soil (pH 6.5, high N, medium P, low K) and distinct climate seasons, with a critical focus on potassium supplementation throughout the year. During the hot, humid, and rainy Kharif season (March/April to October), the primary focus will be on **paddy rice**, advocating for climate-resilient varieties to mitigate rising temperatures and extreme rainfall, alongside **jute** and **sugarcane**. Intercropping with **tropical fruits** like banana and pineapple, coupled with sustainable practices such as mulching and efficient water management, will enhance resilience. As the cooler, drier Rabi season (November to February/March) arrives, crop rotation will shift to **winter vegetables** (e.g., cabbage, potato, tomato), **pulses**, and **oilseeds** (e.g., mustard), which thrive in these conditions and contribute to soil fertility. Tea cultivation should be strategically maintained in areas less susceptible to climate shifts, with continuous monitoring for yield and environmental impact. Overall, the plan integrates extensive **crop rotation** and **intercropping** for soil health and pest control, promotes the adoption of **drought-resistant crop varieties**, and encourages **agroforestry** to provide shade and buffer against increasing heat and variable weather, thereby ensuring sustained productivity and farmer well-being in the face of climate change challenges.",
            "GPT Plan: For Assam’s 12-month cycle, begin the Kharif window (mid-March to early April) by broadcasting or transplanting a climate-resilient, short-duration (90-day) rice variety such as “IR 64-BR” on leveled, well-drained loam, simultaneously applying a split potassium fertilizer (30 kg K₂O ha⁻¹ at planting and a second 20 kg K₂O ha⁻¹ at tillering) to offset the soil’s low K; inter-plant rows of high-value jute (seeded late-April) and sugarcane setts (planted early May) with banana “Grand Naine” suckers and pineapple “MD-2” crowns in the same fields using a staggered strip-intercropping pattern to maximize canopy cover, conserve moisture, and diversify income; employ mulching with rice straw and drip irrigation to manage excess rain and reduce runoff. As the monsoon tapers (late September), finish rice harvest, then in early October sow a mixed pulse-mustard rotation—mung bean (30-day crop) followed by a quick-growing mustard (45-day)—to replenish soil nitrogen and break pest cycles, while applying a final potassium top-dress (15 kg K₂O ha⁻¹) before the Rabi season. From mid-November to early December, transplant winter vegetables—cabbage, potato, and tomato—in raised beds enriched with compost and the remaining K supplement, spacing them to allow companion planting of coriander and marigold for pest deterrence; concurrently, establish a second-year tea clone (e.g., “Camellia sinensis var. assamica”) on gently sloping, shaded plots that received the earlier K applications, monitoring micro-climate buffers. Harvest vegetables by late February, then sow a short-duration (60-day) green manure such as sesbania or cowpea to protect soil over the dry spell, completing the cycle by early March and preparing the land for the next rice planting, thereby ensuring continuous potassium management, crop rotation, intercropping, and climate-adapted practices throughout the year."

        "final_plan": "For Assam, a detailed 12-month crop plan leverages its loamy soil, favorable pH of 6.5, high nitrogen, medium phosphorus, and adequate moisture, critically addressing the low potassium levels with consistent supplementation. The hot, humid, and rainy Kharif season (March/April to October) is ideal for \"IR 64-BR\" paddy rice, planted mid-March to early April with an initial 30 kg K₂O ha⁻¹ and a second 20 kg K₂O ha⁻¹ at tillering. Simultaneously, high-value jute can be seeded in late April and sugarcane setts planted in early May. To maximize canopy cover and diversify income, these are inter-planted in a staggered strip-intercropping pattern with \"Grand Naine\" banana suckers and \"MD-2\" pineapple crowns, employing mulching with rice straw and drip irrigation to manage variable rainfall. Post-rice harvest in late September, the cooler, drier Rabi season (October to February/March) begins with an early October sowing of a mixed pulse-oilseed rotation, such as mung bean followed by mustard, to replenish nitrogen and break pest cycles, alongside a 15 kg K₂O ha⁻¹ top-dress. From mid-November to early December, winter vegetables like cabbage, potato, and tomato are transplanted into raised beds enriched with compost and remaining potassium, with companion planting of herbs for pest deterrence. Tea, specifically \"Camellia sinensis var. assamica,\" should be strategically managed on gently sloping, shaded plots, monitoring micro-climate buffers. After vegetable harvest by late February, a short-duration green manure crop like sesbania or cowpea can be sown to protect soil over the dry spell, completing the cycle by early March and preparing for the next Kharif planting. This comprehensive plan integrates continuous potassium management, crop rotation, intercropping, and climate-adapted practices like agroforestry and drought-resistant varieties to ensure sustained productivity and resilience against increasing heat and weather variability."
